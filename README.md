# Project-Code

The project in the repository is for an online craigslist-like service for CU Boulder students called Buff List.

## Build/Run Code
- Go to http://creative.colorado.edu/~mase4506/SoftwareDev/index.html for fully functional site, you can also download the folder locally and run index.html but the login feature will not be functional locally.

## Test Code
- Log in to website using your colorado.edu email
- Go to each web page, and try out features on each page

## Repo Structure
- The structure of our repo includes html files for every tab and feature we have implemented, and each html page uses the same javascript and css file. We also have stored all of the image assets in their own folder.
